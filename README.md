- [where we salt and hash password](https://github.com/zaida04/cse312-project/blob/main/src/server/routes/users.ts#L65)
- [where we hash the internal stored auth tokens](https://github.com/zaida04/cse312-project/blob/main/src/server/routes/users.ts#L89)
- ["For likes, make sure you cannot like a post twice and ensure this check is made on the back end"](https://github.com/zaida04/cse312-project/blob/main/src/server/routes/likes.ts#L19)
